          <h2>Step One</h2>
          <p>
            After you've installed the app and open the Update Templates item
            view, select which category you would like your first template
            posted to. The info popups on each button describe the difference.
            "Board" will post a template that is visible to all members of this
            board. "User" will post a template that is only to you, but
            available to post across all boards when you click on the "User"
            section.
